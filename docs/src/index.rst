Welcome to Autonet's Documentation!
-----------------------------------
Autonet is a WSGI application that abstracts vendor specific network
device configuration into a standard set of vendor independent API calls.
Autonet eases the burden of automating day-2 network management allowing
a mix of inventory sources and target network devices via a pluggable
framework.
